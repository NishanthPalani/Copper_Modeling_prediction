# Industrial Copper_Modeling_prediction

## Project Overiew

This project aims to develop machine learning models "Regression model for Selling price prediction" & "Classification model for Copper Status prediction" for the copper industry to address the challenges of predicting selling price and lead classification. Manual predictions can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions or accurately capture leads. The models utilizes advanced pre-processing techniques such as null value treatment, data normalization, outlier detection and handling, handling data in the wrong format, identifying the distribution of features.
